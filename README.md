# QuestLog
# A simple website to track and log completed quests and keep track of your level based on experience gained from the quests that you have added.
# When adding a new quest, add the name, what level the quest is, the alignment of the quest, what reward you will receive, and how many experience points you gained by completing the quest. 
# Think of it like a to-do list! All that is needed to run this website is to download, compile, and run the solution from Visual Studio. # Beginner quests will be added automatically.
